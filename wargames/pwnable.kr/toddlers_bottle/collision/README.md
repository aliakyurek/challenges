As an argument, we need to pass 20 bytes for 5 integers to the col binary.

Along with the script, challange can be solved with the following one-liner as well:
```
col@prowl:~$ ./col $'\xc8\xce\xc5\x06\xc8\xce\xc5\x06\xc8\xce\xc5\x06\xc8\xce\xc5\x06\xcc\xce\xc5\x06'
daddy! I just managed to create a hash collision :)
```
